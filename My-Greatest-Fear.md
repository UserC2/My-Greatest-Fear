My Greatest Fear
================
<sup>Would be completing this assignment properly.</sup>


Requirements:
-------------
[^1]  [^2]  
So, the rubric looks something like this:
| Category      | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Thinking      | No rick rolls | Poorly hidden rickroll | 1 properly hidden rickroll | >=2 tastefully hidden rickrolls [^5]: [Here's one you won't be able to see.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxjY_YTksKM) |
| Knowledge     | `.txt` | `.md` | HTML | Use the most obscure HTML in existence and break most markdown interpreters doing it |
| Communication | State your greatest fear | Go into detail | Actually use markdown | Follow the instructions so poorly you get used as a class example |

## Rationale:
* So, why don't I want to do the assignment properly?
	* __Possible reasons:__
		* Laziness
		* For Humourous effect
		* It worked for WhyNot180

What I'm going to do instead:
-----------------------------
+ Use as much arbitrary markdown as possible, half of which appears not to work in VS Code
	+ [this style of link] fails completely[^3]
		> It should link to `https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet` using the reference in `## Useful Info`
+ Add a bunch of nonsense to demonstrate markdown features
+ Probably rick-roll our teacher (you)
+ Utilize several different methods of doing the exact same thing to make the source code inconvenient to read.

## How to use this document
* I suggest viewing the preview first, and then the source code (which explains some of the shenanigans which you may have noticed.)

## Additional Data & Info
- [this style of link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
	> A markdown cheat sheet.
- [^6]: Notice this line appears empty. You can hide text with footnotes.

[^1]: `=` and `-` can be used in place of `#` and `##` for headings.

[^2]: Adding two spaces to the end of the line will put the next source line on a new line when previewed

[^3]: This footnote also refuses to work properly (but is apparently supported on GitHub)

[^4]: All footnotes are invisible to anyone looking at the file preview. (Provided that you're not using VS Code...)
